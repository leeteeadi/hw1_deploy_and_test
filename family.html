		<p>In 2016, I loaded my kids into the minivan and took them
		   on a drive across the Northern midwest states. We went
		   to Wisconsin Dells, the Badlands, Mount Rushmore, Jewel 
		   Cave, and Custer State Park.</p>

		<p>I didn't plan for the fact that the Sturgis Motorcycle
		   Rally would overlap with our trip. Many towns were
		   closed to through traffic and the lack of internet 
		   required that we use paper maps often.</p>
